# GermLang :construction:
A new programming language aimed at being a simplistic yet functional proof of concept DIY programming language.

## Requirements (Development and Running)

Certain debugging features are left commented out, so if you are adding features you can comment/uncomment the interpreter print/return statements at the end of interpreter functions as needed.

- Python3

## Running a Germ program
### Windows

`py -3 GermLang.py FILENAME.germ`

### MacOS/Linux

`./GermLang.py FILENAME.germ`


## TODO

- if/else statements
- Beginning and End file definitions
